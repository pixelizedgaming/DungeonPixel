# DungeonPixel

## Intro
 Problem: No good free procedural dungeons generator.
 
 Solution: write my own and open source it so every kid and their mom can run a dungeon crawling server

## (supposed) Features
  - Data driven procedural dungeon generator: just drop in your worldedit schematics and watch them generate your own custom dungeon!
  - Particle Toolkit: makes using paper particlebuilder slightly easier
  - Custom Items & mobs from json: TODO

## Checklist TODO
  - 2d dungeon generation with hallways like in dnd
  - Accessories with random scaling like genshin/wynncraft, but with the interactability/utility of isaac/terraria
    - 5 accessories per run, 1 of which you can start off with from your collection
    - can start with 3 after upgrades from bosses or other method unlock
    - 
  - Items: weapons can have abilities affecting energy generation, 
  - Ability system: special and ultimate attacks: specials are big attacks on cooldown, ultimates are huge attacks on cooldown + energy regen
  - mobs: trash mobs should have nextbot ai for now, but add minibosses with unique attacks and bosses of course
  - literally everything, nothing is playable rn except stick makes funny particle beam
